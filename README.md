## Essential Code

![Navigation Bar](./Assets/Navbar.png)

- The navigation bar is placed on top of the page to allow the user to move around different pages within the webpage. It has been created in a way that on a mobile screen the brand will take up the entire row and push the internally linked pages underneath it. This way, the mobile screen doesn't have the About, Portfolio, and Contact text written on the page and it shows a clear layout of the current page the user is on.

- The Hamburger Icon is essential to the viewers experience because as a mobile user they are able to click on the icon and choose when they would like to visit another internal page.

![Container with About Me](./Assets/AboutMeContainer.png)

- In the main content of the About Me page, it is important to let the image float to the left so that the text can fill the empty part of the container. While the main content has no white space and is filled with information, the sides and the bottom have empty space to bring the viewers eyes to a specific section.

![Form with placeholder text](./Assets/FirstandLastName.png)

- The form created has a simple layout and the most important area is the text area with the placeholder text inside. It is included so either give an example or extend on the label given. In this example, the label was 'Name:' and the placeholder text expanded to specify 'First and Last name'.
